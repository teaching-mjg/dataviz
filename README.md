The goal of dataviz is to make it easier to learn `ggplot`

## Installation

You can install dataviz from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("teaching-mjg/dataviz")
```

## Contents of `dataviz`
* various psychology data sets

A website with reference material for the package is at
<https://teaching-mjg.github.io/dataviz/>. See the drop-down called
“Articles” that lists tutorials.

## Example

This is how to start using dataviz:

``` r
library(dataviz)
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
